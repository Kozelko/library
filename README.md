# Library App

Simple demo for managing books with plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## Features

-   List books as cards.
-   Add a new book via the “Add Book” button (modal form).
-   Remove a book via the “Remove” button on each card.
-   Toggle the “Read” state via the “Change Read” button.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html` – page markup and modal with the form.
-   `style.css` – base styling, including modal and cards.
-   `script.js` – logic implemented via the `LibraryApp` class (state, render, modal, add/remove/toggle).

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` directly in the browser (no server needed).
2. Click “Add Book”, fill the form, and save.
3. Use “Remove” on a card to delete a book.
